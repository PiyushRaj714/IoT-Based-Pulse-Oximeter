# IoT-Based-Pulse-Oximeter

MAX30100 is an integrated pulse oximeter and heart-rate monitor sensor solution. It’s an optical sensor that derives its readings from emitting two wavelengths of light from two LEDs – a red and an infrared one – then measuring the absorbance of pulsing blood through a photodetector.


This particular LED color combination is optimized for reading the data through the tip of one’s finger. It is fully configurable through software registers and the digital output data is stored in a 16-deep FIFO within the device. It has an I2C digital interface to communicate with a host microcontroller.
